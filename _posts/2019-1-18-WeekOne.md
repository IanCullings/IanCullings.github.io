title: The First Week
---

As of around noon on Friday, I've officially been in Santander for one week, although looking back it honestly feels like a month.  With all the new experiences, the new language, and the very long days (rarely with time for a siesta) it's been quite an amazing experience.

So, there is a lot to write about!  First of all, my flight!

As someone who hates flying, the idea of taking an airplane across the Atlantic wasn't exactly the best, and I have to say it lived up to the expectations.  After finding my seat and chatting with the guy next to me for a bit (who had just gotten laid off, 
and was making the best of his severence by taking a vacation in Madrid) I sat down for 7 hours of essentially hell.  Three movies, two crying babies, and one terrible airplane dinner, I arrived in Madrid around 2AM EST.  
I made my way through Spanish customs, which are much more relaxed than their angry, unpaid American counterparts (I forgot to take off my belt and watch in my sleepless stupor, and still went through the metal detector without any problems).  I got a few coffees and next thing I knew I was on my plane to Santander.

I arrived in Santander to the smell of salt water, and met my host family out front.  We drove back, and made the usual small talk, weather, family, etc, before arriving at their home.
There I was introduced to my first taste of Spanish food, the torilla Española, baked torilla with potatoes, eggs, and vegtables.  ¡Que delicioso!  We chatted for a while before I retired to finally get some sleep.

Over the next few days, I had the chance to see some of Santander, and get my bearings in the city.  Some of the best features of Santander are the escaleras: outdoor escalators 
built into the sidewalk to take you up the hill.  They culminate in the fenicular in the middle of town, a small cable-car esque ride that takes you up the hill.  We could really use one of those on the slope at Cornell!
I also got a chance to see the University of Cantabria (UC), where I'll be studying.  Unlike Cornell, which is a small city in and of itself, UC just takes up one street in Santander.

On Monday, our intensive Spanish class began, which is quite different from anything I've done before.  Taking up 4 hours in the morning and 2 in the evening (with a break for siesta of course), we
mostly just chat about ourselves, Spanish culture, and anything else that comes up, with some grammatical and writing lessons thrown in.  To be honest it's been a bit rough, the combination of the time change (which I still haven't fullt adjusted to) 
and my lack of formal Spanish lessons in a long time really adds up.  Still, it is a lot of fun, and good practice for more typical conversations, rather than formal lessons persay.

Over the week I've just been focused on class for the morning and afternoon, then going out and exploring Santander in the evenings.  There is a lot to see and do, and I'm excited to see more of the city this weekend.  Look for another post, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on my journey so far!

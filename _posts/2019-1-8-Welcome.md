Hello everyone!  In just three days, I will be touching down in [Santander, Spain,](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santander,+Cantabria,+Spain/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4949ae8a6bee71:0xd27cdc801682ba96?ved=2ahUKEwjIv5DWtt7fAhUkn-AKHU20CV0Q8gEwFnoECAUQCA) to study Environmental Engineering for a semester!  I am incredibly excited to go, and to experience everything I can in Spain and throughout as much of Europe as I can get to.  Some things I am especially looking forward to:
* Experiencing a new culture and way of life
* Traveling across Europe and seeing everything I can
* Learning in a new academic environment
* Making new friends in Spain

And some things I am less excited about:
* Logistics: As I write this I still have not packed, or taken care of a few other key details.  Wish me luck!
* Air Travel: I've never been a huge fan of flying, and due to the time change I'll be landing in Spain in what is 2am Eastern Time :(
* Jet lag: Like most college students I'm a big fan of sleep, and thus not too excited to be jet lagged

Look for my next post in a few days once I arrive!  And for all of you readers, I would love to hear from you.  Please comment or message me while I'm there, and let me know if you have any travel recommendations!

Until next time,

Ian

Hi Everyone!  My name is Ian Cullings, I'm a junior at Cornell University studying Environmental Engineering!  I will be spending the next semester in lovely Santander, Spain, through the [University of Cantabria exchange program](http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/eac20/spain/), and documenting my travels through this blog.  If you have any questions, I highly encourage you to reach out via email or my social media, linked in the website footer.
